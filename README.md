# learnyounode
Learnyounode is a nodejs tool to learn nodejs. 

In this repository you will find some "reference" implementations of the examples, made by me. 

They are not meant to be a guide for anybody; I wrote these examples while studying by myself.

## how to... 

``` 
npm install learnyounode --global 
```

don't forget to `sudo` if you're on mac or linux. 

Then, if you want to start learning NodeJs, 

```
learnyounode
```
and follow the instructions.
